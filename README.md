# About me
My name is Sehar Tabassum. I'm a Mathematician turning to a Data Analyst. I'm able to use Python (Jupyter Notebooks), SQL, Excel, and Power BI to analyze data. I'm a analytical, goal-oriented, assertive person with technical and interpersonal skills to find solutions when needed. Also, I love facing new challenges and that is why I love analyzing data. You never get bored finding insights, making predictions, and showing them by telling an interesting story that captivates people's attention.

Since I am amazed by power of data, I decided to move into the Data Analytics field.
